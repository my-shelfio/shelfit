description: Why expo-shelfit's code is the shape it is — one-way import direction, where console/process.exit are allowed, what each display mode queries against the undocumented EAS GraphQL API, and the alternatives rejected along the way. Read before changing src/ or any query.

# expo-shelfit architecture

## MUST

- **Imports run one way**: `bin → cli → args / features/* → shared/*`. Never in reverse, never sideways between features.
- **`command.mjs` is the only place that calls `console.*`**; only `bin/cli.mjs` may call `process.exit`.
- **`EXPO_TOKEN` is the only credential** — never from `argv`, never written to disk.
- **Every UTC boundary stays UTC**; `--local` shifts display only.
- **A per-account or per-app failure degrades one row**, it never fails the run.

Directory layout is in
[CONTRIBUTING.md#project-layout](../../packages/expo-shelfit/CONTRIBUTING.md#project-layout).
The design decisions below aren't derivable from that tree alone, so they
stay here rather than there.

**Import direction is one-way and enforced by convention, not tooling.** Every arrow below is an import that exists today; the rule is that no others get added. Never in reverse (`shared/api.mjs` must not import from `features/`), and never sideways between features (`features/stats/` must not import from `features/list/`). The picture is loose about two things on purpose: it unions the three features, so an arrow may come from only one of them (`service.mjs → args.mjs` is `--stats` alone, pulling one default constant), and `errors.mjs` is drawn detached because it is importable from anywhere while importing nothing itself.

```

**No feature imports `shared/api.mjs`** — `src/cli.mjs` builds the client and passes it in. That injection is what lets `service.mjs` be tested against a fake client instead of a mocked `fetch`.

**`command.mjs` is the only place that calls `console.*`.** `service.mjs` fetches and aggregates, returning plain data plus a `warnings` string array, and `format.mjs` turns that data into rows — neither prints.

**`src/*` never calls `process.exit` or reads `process.argv` directly**, so everything stays unit-testable. Only `bin/cli.mjs` is allowed to exit the process — it's the sole place that catches `CliError`/`ApiError` and converts them into a printed message + exit code.

**Auth**: a personal access token in `EXPO_TOKEN` is the only supported credential — never read from `argv`, never written to disk. Missing token throws `CliError` in `resolveAuthHeaders` (`src/cli.mjs`).

**Display modes are mutually exclusive**: `--stats`, `--members`, and `--history` cannot be combined with each other — combining any two is a `CliError`.

**`--usage` is a deprecated alias for `--stats`, `--plan` is a deprecated alias for `--members`** (both removed in the next major). `parseArgs` sets the same `opts.stats`/`opts.members` for each pair and appends `DEPRECATED_USAGE_WARNING`/`DEPRECATED_PLAN_WARNING` to `opts.warnings` rather than printing it, so `parseArgs` stays I/O-free. Error messages echo whichever name was typed (`args.mjs#modeFlag`, keyed by an `aliasFlags` object with one entry per mode that has a deprecated alias), so `--usage --plan` must not report `--stats --members`.

**`--account`/`--app` narrow client-side** (`src/shared/filter.mjs`), at the points marked in the fetch diagram below. Both match slug or EAS Display name (case-insensitive, exact); `--app`'s ambiguity is scoped to one account, so a Display name shared across accounts matches in both. `--app` is incompatible with `--members`, which skips step 2 entirely. No match throws `CliError` with Levenshtein "Did you mean" suggestions.

**`--local` switches which calendar day BUILD/SUBMIT/UPDATE fall on** (`src/shared/dates.mjs#formatBuildDate`, called with `{ time: false }` for all three — the default list no longer shows time-of-day at all). All three columns share one date formatter, so `--local` shifts all three together, never just one. Every UTC boundary (`calendarMonths`, `inclusiveEnd`, `isoDate`) stays UTC unconditionally, since `--stats`'s month bucketing compares them directly against build `createdAt`. Incompatible with `--stats`/`--members`, neither of which has a date column `--local` affects.

**`--max-width <n>` fits the table into a fixed number of terminal columns** (`src/shared/terminal/render.mjs#fitWidths`), taking one column at a time off whichever column is currently widest until it fits, and never below a column's own header — a column narrower than its header no longer says what it holds. `truncate` and `width` walk the same cluster iterator, so a cell is never measured one way and cut another, and a cut never lands inside a wide character or a ZWJ-joined sequence. It applies to every display mode, since all three render through the same `renderTable`.

It is **off by default rather than following `process.stdout.columns`**: the table is the only output this CLI has, so shortening cells that fit today would silently change what every existing invocation prints. There is also no upper bound and no error for a value below the table's own minimum — a caller passing `$COLUMNS` shouldn't have to know a cap, and a too-small number shrinks as far as the headers allow and stops.

**How data is fetched** — all against `https://api.expo.dev/graphql`, concurrency-limited to 8 via `createSemaphore`/`mapWithConcurrency` in `src/shared/concurrency.mjs`:

```mermaid
flowchart TB
  s1["1. meActor { accounts }<br/>one request, always"]
  s1 -->|"--account narrows here"| s2["2. account.byId · appsPaginated(first: 100)<br/>one request per account, cursor-paginated"]
  s2 -->|"--app narrows here"| s3["3. app.byId · fetchAppOverview<br/>builds + submissions + runtime.updates<br/>one request per app"]
  s3 --> list["default list<br/>one row per build × platform"]

  s1 -.->|"--members: no app list at all"| mem["account.byId · subscription,<br/>ownerUserActor, membersPaginated<br/>one request per account"]
  mem --> memout["--members<br/>one row per member"]

  s2 -.->|"--stats: step 3 replaced"| st["app.byId · countBuildsByMonth<br/>paged builds + metrics.buildDuration<br/>as many requests as pages"]
  st --> stout["--stats<br/>one row per month"]
```

The narrowing arrows are the point of `--account`/`--app`: both are applied before the step they precede, so a filtered-out account or app never costs a request.

Step 3 (`src/shared/api.mjs#fetchAppOverview`) is where the query shape matters: `builds` is aliased per platform as `<platform>Builds`, with SUBMIT and UPDATE hanging off each build as sub-selections rather than as separate top-level fields, so every row gets its own and the request count is unchanged. `builds` also carries each build's `sdkVersion`/`cliVersion` (the `SDK`/`CLI` columns, always shown, no flag gates them). SUBMIT comes from `Build.submissions`, the reverse of `Submission.submittedBuild`, so it is exactly that build attempt's submission — no client-side matching, and an unsubmitted build shows `-` instead of borrowing a newer build's value. UPDATE has no build to belong to (an OTA targets a *runtime version*), so it comes from `Build.runtime`'s `updates`; a build with a null `runtime` shows `-`. `RuntimeUpdatesFilterInput` accepts only `channel`, so one runtime's page mixes both platforms and `latestRuntimeUpdate` filters on `Update.platform` client-side — hence `first: 10` rather than `first: 1`. That comparison is case-folded on purpose: `Update.platform` is a plain `String!` (`"ios"`) while `Build.platform` is the `AppPlatform` enum (`"IOS"`), and comparing them strictly matches nothing — emptying the UPDATE column for every row with no error to notice, since "no update yet" is a legitimate result. Every response is client-sorted by `createdAt` descending since the API's order is undocumented

`--stats` buckets its paged builds client-side by platform + UTC calendar month (`countBuildsByMonth`, which counts FINISHED/ERRORED/CANCELED and leaves a build in any other status out of every bucket), also summing each build's `metrics.buildDuration` (EAS queue wait deliberately excluded) into the `BUILD MINUTES` column — it does not query billing-scoped fields (`subscription`/`billingPeriod`/ `usageMetrics`), since those are tied to EAS's billing cycle and can't be sliced into arbitrary calendar ranges.

`--members` queries each account in parallel regardless of member count, paginating `membersPaginated` further only when an organization exceeds one page.
`Account.ownerUserActor` is non-null exactly for personal accounts (confirmed against the real API), so `src/features/members/service.mjs` branches on it: a personal account becomes one row (`ORG` "-", `MEMBER`/`ROLE` = the owner), an organization becomes one row per member. A robot member has no `userActor` (only `User` actors get one) and is named via `actor`'s `Robot` inline fragment instead — that fragment is only valid on `actor` (typed `Actor`, the real interface), not on `ownerUserActor` (typed `UserActor`), which errors if a `... on Robot` fragment is added to it.

**`--group-by <account|app>` picks what a `--stats` row counts** (`--stats`-only, default `account`). `app` swaps the ACCOUNT column for APP and makes each (account, app) pair its own group; it adds **no API calls**, since `src/features/stats/service.mjs` already fetched per-app counts and was merely summing them. Two consequences worth keeping: grouping is by pair, so same-named apps in different accounts never merge; and failure gets finer-grained — one app's failed build fetch degrades only its own rows, while an account whose *app list* failed contributes no rows at all and is reported on stderr only.

Per-account/per-app failures don't fail the run: a row still prints with `-` and the reason goes to stderr.
